# Recursive-Shortest-Path

Let mxn be a matrix of 0 and 1 values. Write the C program that finds the shortest path from 0x0 to
mxn point. 1 values in the matrix represents the path, while 0 represents the wall. So you cannot go
to the coordinate or position with 0 value. You can move in four directions in total. Up, down, left and
right. Below is an example path.
